# Open Publishing Foundation

The Open Publishing Foundation creates and distributes typeset works of public domain literature under the GPL-3 License
for the consumption in e-book formats or their free use in publishing. The aim of this orginisation is to re-produce 
high-quality typeset works, focusing upon works that are either out of print or extreamly expensive to purchase. All
works will be written using the Latex or Groff/Troff typesetting systems and will be compiled to the ePub and PDF formats.

## Contribution Guide

If you would like to contribute towards the Open Publishing Foundation, please create a repository and open an issue 
[here](https://github.com/Open-Publishing-Foundation/Open-Publishing-Foundation/issues). Your repository must meet certain
criteria:

- All scripts, code or text must be contained within the repository.
- Adequite build instructions must be provided.
- The re-produced work must either be in the Public domain, free to use, or permission must be gained from the copywrite holder.
- The repository must be licenced under the GPL-3 Licence.

If your contribution is accepted, we will grant you membership to the orginisation and will ask you to transfer the
repository to the Open Publushing Foundation account.
